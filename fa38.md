## Tools

### Required

{% tool 'soldering-iron' %}
{% tool 'solder' %}
{% tool 'wire-cutters' %}

### Optional

{% tool 'multi-meter' %}
{% tool 'desoldering-pump' %}
{% iconCard 'Component Sorting Sheet', 'To identify and keep track of every part in the kit, download and print the [Component Sorting Sheet](/assets/fa38/fa38-sorting-1.1.pdf)', '/assets/pdf-download.png' %}


## Standoffs and Header (Bag 1) {.step}

---

{% lightbox '/assets/fa38/colour-standoffs.jpg', 'md' %}

### Insert Standoffs {.step}

Note that there are two different ends on the plastic standoffs. The locking end has tabs with a right angle to prevent them from being removed after installation, while the non-locking end has smooth tabs. Insert the locking ends of the standoffs from the bottom of the PCB.

---

{% lightbox '/assets/fa38/colour-header.jpg', 'md' %}

### Populate 8-Pin Header {.step}

Insert the 8-pin header into the holes marked “CON1.” Make sure to place the short, silver pins through the bottom of the PCB so that the PCB rests on the black plastic posts. Solder the header from the top of the PCB and <u>do not trim</u> the leads afterward.

## Resistors (Bag 2) {.step}

---

{% lightbox '/assets/15ips/res-bend.jpg', 'md' %}

### Bend Resistors {.step}

Bend the resistor leads 90 degrees at the body so they can be inserted into the PCB.

---

{% resCalc %}
### Sort Resistors {.step}    

Resistor values are identified by colored bands on the body of the resistor. To sort resistors, use the color code calculator above, or test them with a multi-meter set to read resistance.

{% alert, 'To measure resistors quickly you can remove the probes from your multi-meter and place the leads of the resistor directly in the probe sockets.', 'success', 'Pro Tip' %}

---

{% lightbox '/assets/fa38/res-place.jpg', 'md' %}

### Place Resistors {.step}

Place the resistors into their respective positions on the PCB. As you place each resistor, bend its leads against the bottom of the PCB so that it stays in place during soldering.

---

{% lightbox '/assets/fa38/res-solder.jpg', 'md' %}

### Solder Resistors {.step}

Solder the resistors to the PCB. Observe good soldering technique: heat the pad and lead for 2-3 seconds, apply a small bit of solder, and continue to heat the pad for another 2-3 seconds. The finished joints should be shiny and should have just enough solder to cover the pad entirely.

---

{% lightbox '/assets/fa38/res-trim.jpg', 'md' %}

### Trim Resistors {.step}

Use clippers to trim away the excess leads. Clip as closely as possible to the joint without clipping the joint itself.

## Capacitors and Diodes (Bag 3) {.step}

---

{% lightbox '/assets/fa38/diodes.jpg', 'md' %}

### Populate Diodes {.step}

Place each diode so that the line on the component matches the line on the PCB. Double check the orientation, then solder and trim.

---

{% lightbox '/assets/fa38/caps-film.jpg', 'md' %}

### Populate Film Capacitors {.step}
The small, red components are film capacitors. These capacitors are not polarized and can be placed in either direction. Place them, solder then trim the leads.

---

{% lightbox '/assets/fa38/caps-tant.jpg', 'md' %}

### Populate Tantalum Capacitors {.step}
The larger, yellow capacitors are tantalum. These are polarized, so they must be placed in a certain direction. The positive lead is slightly longer and marked with a "+" symbol. Align this lead with the "+" on the PCB. Double check the orientation, then solder and trim.

---

{% lightbox '/assets/fa38/caps-electro.jpg', 'md' %}

### Populate Electrolytic Capacitors {.step}
The remaining capacitors are electrolytic. Like the tantalums, these are polarized. The positive lead is longer while the negative lead is marked with a stripe on the body. Place them, double check the orientation, then solder and trim.

---

{% lightbox '/assets/fa38/2N3019.jpg', 'md' %}

### Populate T5 (2N3019) {.step}
T5 is a transistor, not a capacitor or diode. But we placed it in this bag so that it would be impossible to mix up with the other silver-can transistor. Place the pins of the transistor through the nylon spacer. Then, place the 2N3019 in the T5 position, solder, and trim.

## Transistors (Bag 4) {.step}

---

{% lightbox '/assets/fa38/transistors.jpg', 'md' %}

### Populate Transistors {.step}
Populate the remaining transistors. Put the nylon spacer on T6 before soldering. Note that the BC557s have a silver top, which corresponds to the filled-in transistor shapes on the PCB. Solder and trim.

## Final Checks
    
Before you wrap up, check the following things:

{% checks 'capacitor', 'resistor', 'diode', 'transistor', 'solder', 'trim' %}
