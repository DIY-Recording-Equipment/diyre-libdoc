### Populate Transistors {.step}

There are two important things to note about transistors. First, the orientation: one side of the body is flat while the other is round. And second, the part number: carefully check the markings on the sorting sheet against those on the body before inserting them.

        
Identify the transistors, place them in the correct positions orientation, double check, and then solder and trim.
