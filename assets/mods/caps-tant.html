     <div class="step-description">
     <p>The larger, yellow capacitors are tantalum. These are polarized, so they must be placed in a certain direction. The positive lead is slightly longer and marked with a "+" symbol. Align this lead with the "+" on the PCB. Double check the orientation, then solder and trim.</p>
