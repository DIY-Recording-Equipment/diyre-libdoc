### Sort Resistors {.step}    

Resistor values are identified by colored bands on the body of the resistor. To sort resistors, use our [Resistor Color Code Calculator](https://www.diyrecordingequipment.com/pages/resistor-color-code-calculator) or test them with a multi-meter set to read resistance. (Pro tip: to measure resistors quickly you can remove the probes from your multi-meter and place the leads of the resistor directly in the probe sockets.)
