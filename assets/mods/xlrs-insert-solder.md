### Insert XLRs and Solder {.step}

Now reheat the middle pad while pushing the XLR jack up into the PCB from underneath. Once the solder melts, the XLR jack will slide easily into place. Remove your iron and allow the joint to cool while holding the XLR jack in place. Repeat this process for the other pair of XLR jacks, then solder all of the metal pins of the XLRs.
