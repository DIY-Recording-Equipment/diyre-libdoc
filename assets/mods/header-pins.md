### Populate Header Pins {.step}

As with the header sockets, these pins must be perpendicular to the board to mate correctly. Follow the same technique:

1. Solder a single pad in the middle of the header's footprint.
2. Place the header and press gently against the solder joint, while heating the edge of the soldered pad.
3. After the solder liquifies and the header snaps into place, remove the soldering iron and hold the header in place until the solder cools (about 5 seconds).
4. Now solder the rest of the pins of the header from underneath.
