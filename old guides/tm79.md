Welcome to the [{{ product }}]({{ product_url }}) assembly guide. If this is your first DIY project ever, we recommend reading our [Getting Started Guide]({{ getting_started_url }}) before beginning.

Before you begin, check the revision of your PCB. If yours has the version number "v1.1" on the bottom you are on the correct page. If it does not, please follow the [TM79 v1.0 assembly guide](http://www.diyrecordingequipment.com/pages/tm79-manual).

## Tools

### Required

{% tool 'soldering-iron' %}
{% tool 'solder' %}
{% tool 'wire-cutters' %}

### Optional

{% tool 'multi-meter' %}
{% tool 'desoldering-pump' %}

### Component Sorting Sheet
---

{% iconCard 'Component Sorting Sheet', 'To identify and keep track of every part in the kit, download and print the [Component Sorting Sheet](/assets/tm79/tm79-sorting-2.0.pdf)', '/assets/pdf-download.png' %}


## Standoffs and Header (Bag 1) {.step}

---

{% lightbox '/assets/tm79/colour-standoffs.jpg', 'md' %}

### Insert Standoffs {.step}

Note that there are two different ends on the plastic standoffs. The locking end has tabs with a right angle to prevent them from being removed after installation, while the non-locking end has smooth tabs. Insert the locking ends of the standoffs from the bottom of the PCB.

---

{% lightbox '/assets/tm79/colour-header.jpg', 'md' %}

### Populate 8-Pin Header {.step}

Insert the 8-pin header into the holes marked “CON1.” Make sure to place the short, silver pins through the bottom of the PCB so that the PCB rests on the black plastic posts. Solder the header from the top of the PCB and <u>do not trim</u> the leads afterward.

---

{% lightbox '/assets/tm79/ic-socket.jpg', 'md' %}

### Tape and Solder IC Socket {.step}

Insert the IC socket so that the notches on the sockets align with the markings on the PCB. Secure in place with tape. Then flip the PCB over and solder in place. Remove the tape.

## Resistors (Bag 2) {.step}

---

{% lightbox '/assets/15ips/res-bend.jpg', 'md' %}

### Bend Resistors {.step}

Bend the resistor leads 90 degrees at the body so they can be inserted into the PCB.

---

{% resCalc %}
### Sort Resistors {.step}    

Resistor values are identified by colored bands on the body of the resistor. To sort resistors, use the color code calculator above, or test them with a multi-meter set to read resistance.

{% alert, 'To measure resistors quickly you can remove the probes from your multi-meter and place the leads of the resistor directly in the probe sockets.', 'success', 'Pro Tip' %}

---

{% lightbox '/assets/tm79/res-place.jpg', 'md' %}

### Place Resistors {.step}

Place the resistors into their respective positions on the PCB. As you place each resistor, bend its leads against the bottom of the PCB so that it stays in place during soldering.

---

{% lightbox '/assets/tm79/res-solder.jpg', 'md' %}

### Solder Resistors {.step}

Solder the resistors to the PCB. Observe good soldering technique: heat the pad and lead for 2-3 seconds, apply a small bit of solder, and continue to heat the pad for another 2-3 seconds. The finished joints should be shiny and should have just enough solder to cover the pad entirely.

---

{% lightbox '/assets/tm79/res-trim.jpg', 'md' %}

### Trim Resistors {.step}

Use clippers to trim away the excess leads. Clip as closely as possible to the joint without clipping the joint itself.

## Capacitors and Transistors (Bag 3) {.step}
---

{% lightbox '/assets/tm79/caps-small.jpg', 'md' %}

### Populate Small Capacitors {.step}

Place the smaller capacitors in their respective places. These capacitors are not polarized and therefore can be placed in either direction. Solder then trim the leads.

---

{% lightbox '/assets/tm79/caps-large.jpg', 'md' %}

### Populate Large Capacitors {.step}

These capacitors are polarized, so they must be placed in a certain direction. The positive lead is slightly longer, while the negative lead is marked with a stripe on the body of the capacitor. Place the capacitors with the positive lead in the pad next to the "+" marking on the PCB. Double check their orientation, then solder and trim.

---

{% lightbox '/assets/tm79/transistors.jpg', 'md' %}

### Populate Transistors {.step}

There are two important things to note about transistors. First, the orientation: one side of the body is flat while the other is round. And second, the part number: carefully check the markings on the sorting sheet against those on the body before inserting them.

Identify the transistors, place them in the correct positions orientation, double check, and then solder and trim.

## Transformers (Bag 4) {.step}

---

{% lightbox '/assets/tm79/trafos.jpg', 'md' %}

### Place Transformers {.step}
Place the transformer in the X1 and X2 positions. Note that there's a small notch in the plastic near pin 1. Line this notch up with the corresponding one on the PCB, then solder the transformer to the PCB. To prevent damaging the transformer, leave 20 seconds between solder joints. This allows the coil wires time to cool down between joints.

## IC (Bag 5) {.step}

---

{% lightbox '/assets/tm79/ic.jpg', 'md' %}

### Place IC in Socket {.step}

The leads of the IC must be slightly bent to fit perfectly into the socket. Press one row of leads against a flat surface until they form a 90-degree angle with the body of the IC. Then do this for the other row.

IC polarity is indicated by a dot or notch on one side of the body. Align this side with the notch in the socket. Place the IC in this direction, and press it completely into the socket.

## Final Checks
---

Before you wrap up, check the following things:

{% checks 'capacitor', 'resistor', 'ic', 'transistor', 'solder' %}
