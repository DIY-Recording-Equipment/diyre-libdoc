Thank you for purchasing a [73P]([kit url in store]).

If this is your first DIY project ever, we recommend reading our [Getting Started Guide](http://www.diyrecordingequipment.com/pages/getting-started).

The 73P is meant for intermediate builders who have experience with PCB soldering and using a multi-meter. Our number-one tip is to take your time. There are 180 parts in this kit and as many opportunities for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy's_law">Murphy's Law</a> to come true. So don't hurry, enjoy the build, and always "check twice, solder once."

In order to catch any mistakes early, we've included test steps at the end of some of the sections. We highly recommend doing all of these tests, especially for your first 73P. If your unit fails a test, contact us via the "Help" button below and we'll help you fix it. It's much easier to find the problem when the entire unit is not built yet.

Best of luck and enjoy the process!

## <span style="background-color: yellow;padding: 5px;">Important: Check PCB Revision</span>

To easily find parts and keep track of which ones you have populated, use the [73P Interactive Build Map](https://maps.diy.re/73p2/).

<!-- Section 1 -->

## Power and Miscellaneous {.step}
In this section we will populate the power supply and some miscellaneous parts that don't fit in other sections. Note that the parts of the circuit discussed in each section don't always correspond exactly to the parts assembled in that section. In this section, for example, we will populate some parts that are not discussed until later sections.

For this and future sections use all of the parts in the corresponding bag number. The bags are split up into smaller bags to make keeping track of parts easier, but the smaller bags do not correspond to individual steps.

<img class="schematic" src="/assets/73p2/block01-power.png" />
One of the main challenges of adapting a vintage Neve circuit to the 500-series is achieving the correct power voltage. The vintage consoles ran on a single +24v rail, while 500-series modules run on dual +/-16v rails. Our solution to this is to regulate the +16v rail down to +8v and treat the -16v rail as 0v. This creates a spread of 24v between the rails (+8 to -16), which from the components' perspective is exactly the same as being powered by a +24v supply.

+16v power passes first through F1, which is a self-resetting fuse. This protects the 500-series rack in case there is a short circuit on the 73P. Then it passes through a slow-start circuit made up of R43-R45, C29, and T10. This prevents the unit from drawing excessive current when it starts up. On power-up, the current is limited by R45. But after C29 has charged, T10 turns on and essentially becomes a very low-value resistor, bypassing R45. +16v is regulated to +8v via R46, D3, and T9. R46 and the zener diode D3 set the voltage to 9v. The transistor T9 acts as a buffer, providing the current the circuit needs. T9 also drops the voltage about 1v, giving us +8v. The small capacitor C28 filters noise out of the power rail. Power is fed to the gain blocks of the preamp through R19 and R42. The net N goes to the PRE 1 and PRE 2 stages, while M goes to the Output. Finally, the big capacitors C11, C12, and C27 provide reservoirs of current for the preamp circuitry.

### Bend Resistors {.step}

Bend the resistor leads 90 degrees at the body so they can be inserted into the PCB.

{% lightbox 'https://diyrecordingequipment.com/pages/resistor-color-code-calculator', 'md' %}

### Sort Resistors {.step}
Unlike other projects you may have built, the 73P does not have all the part values printed on the PCB. Where they are not specified, reference the parts list in that step of the guide and/or the Interactive Build Map.

To sort resistors, use our [Resistor Color Code Calculator](https://www.diyrecordingequipment.com/pages/resistor-color-code-calculator) or test them with a multi-meter set to read resistance. (Pro tip: to measure resistors quickly you can remove the probes from your multi-meter and place the leads of the resistor directly in the probe sockets.)

{% lightbox '/assets/73p2/01-res-place.jpg', 'md' %}

### Place Resistors {.step}
Place the resistors into their respective positions on the PCB. As you place each resistor, bend its leads against the bottom of the PCB so that it stays in place during soldering.

	<span style="font-weight: bold;background: yellow;">Important:</span> Before continuing, double check that you are following the correct guide. Check the revision number in the upper-right of the main PCB. If yours says, v1.1, you are in the right place. If yours says v1.0, follow the [73P v1.0 assembly guide](https://manuals.diy.re/73p).

---

{% lightbox '/assets/73p2/01-res-solder.jpg', 'md' %}

### Solder Resistors {.step}

Solder the resistors to the PCB. Observe good soldering technique: heat the pad and lead for 2-3 seconds, apply a small bit of solder, and continue to heat the pad for another 2-3 seconds. The finished joints should be shiny and should have just enough solder to cover the pad entirely.

---

{% lightbox '/assets/73p2/01-res-trim.jpg', 'md' %}

### Trim Resistors {.step}

Use clippers to trim away the excess leads. Clip as closely as possible to the joint without clipping the joint itself.

---

{% lightbox '/assets/73p2/01-diodes.jpg', 'md' %}

### Populate Diodes {.step}

Place each diode so that the line on the component matches the line on the PCB. Double check the orientation, then solder and trim.

{% lightbox '/assets/73p2/01-caps-small.jpg', 'md' %}

### Populate Small Capacitors, Transistor, and Fuse {.step}
Place T10 so that it's orientation matches the shape on the PCB. The smaller capacitors and fuse not polarized and therefore can be placed in either direction. Solder then trim the leads.

{% lightbox '/assets/73p2/01-caps-large.jpg', 'md' %}

### Populate Large Capacitors {.step}

These capacitors are polarized, so they must be placed in a certain direction. The positive lead is slightly longer, while the negative lead is marked with a stripe on the body of the capacitor. Place the capacitors with the positive lead in the pad next to the "+" marking on the PCB. Double check their orientation, then solder and trim.

{% lightbox '/assets/73p2/01-led-place.jpg', 'md' %}

### Place 48v LED {.step}
Place the red LED in the LED1 position on the <strong>bottom</strong> side of the PCB. Orient the LED so that the longer lead goes in the "+" hole. Notice that the leads have a flat segment about 1/4" from the LED body. Insert the LED until the bottom of this flat segment, then bend it towards where the front panel will be. Bend the leads against the other side of the PCB, but <em>do not solder yet</em>.

{% lightbox '/assets/73p2/01-led-solder.jpg', 'md' %}

### Solder 48v LED {.step}
Next we'll ensure the alignment of the LED by putting on the front panel. Place the PCB in the bracket and fasten it with at least two screws from bag 8.1. Attach the front panel with the washer and nut of J1. Confirm that LED1 is sitting flush with the front panel, then solder and trim the leads close to the solder joint. Then remove the front panel, take the PCB out of the bracket, and put the screws back in bag 8.1. Set the washer and nut for J1 aside until step 8.3.

{% lightbox '/assets/73p2/01-switches.jpg', 'md' %}

### Place Switches {.step}
Place the switches and use a small screwdriver to bend a couple of the leads against the bottom of the PCB. Solder and trim.

{% lightbox '/assets/73p2/01-relay.jpg', 'md' %}

### Populate Relay {.step}
Place the relay so that the white line on the body aligns with the line on the PCB. Bend some of the leads against the bottom of the PCB to hold it in place. Double check the orientation, then solder and trim.

{% lightbox '/assets/73p2/01-headers.jpg', 'md' %}

### Populate Header and Socket {.step}
It can be tricky to mount headers and sockets exactly perpendicular to the PCB. Our preferred technique is:

        
1. Fill a single pad in the middle of the header's footprint with solder.
2. Place the header and press gently against the solder joint while heating the edge of the
soldered pad.
3. After the solder liquifies and the header snaps into place, remove the soldering iron and hold
the header in place until the solder cools (about 5 seconds).
4. Now solder the rest of the pins of the header from underneath.

For the X2 header, make sure the plastic tab aligns with the line on the PCB.

{% lightbox '/assets/73p2/01-heatsink-assemble.jpg', 'md' %}

### Assemble Heat Sink {.step}
The two large transistors T8 and T9 will be attached to the same heat sink. The silver side of the transistors is meant for thermal coupling and will be placed against the heat sink. And to prevent shorting, one of them must be electrically isolated via the shoulder washer and insulator pad. Assemble the parts in this order, from left to right:

        
1. Screw
2. Shoulder washer, place the narrower part inside the transistor
3. Transistor 1, text facing out, silver side facing heatsink
4. Insulator pad
5. Heat sink, with the two pins facing the same direction as the transistor leads
6. Transistor 2, text facing out, silver side facing heatsink
7. Black washer
8. Nut

Tighten the screw just enough that the assembly holds together.

{% lightbox '/assets/73p2/01-heatsink-solder.jpg', 'md' %}

### Place Heat Sink Assembly {.step}
Place the assembly so that the side with the insulator pad and shoulder washer goes in T8. Align the assembly so that all the parts sit nicely in the PCB, then tighten the screw. Solder and trim the transistors.

{% lightbox '/assets/73p2/01-test.jpg', 'md' %}

### Test Power {.step}
For this and all following test steps, connect and power up the 73P before testing and power down and disconnect after.

        
1. Set your multi-meter to read DC volts. (If your meter has multiple DC ranges, set it to 200v DC).
2. Probe the 0v test point with the black probe. For all future tests with the multi-meter, the black probe goes on 0v.
3. Probe the V+ test point with the red probe. The voltage should be within 24-26v (the voltage will drop closer to 24v after the amplifier circuits are added).
4. Engage the 48 switch (3rd from the top). LED1 should illuminate.

Did your 73P pass the first test? Great! Proceed with confidence. If not, double check your solder joints, the resistor values, and the orientation of D3. If these are all correct, please contact us via the "Help" button below.

<!-- Section 2 -->

## Direct Input {.step}
<img class="schematic" src="/assets/73p2/block02-di.png" />
The DI circuit is a high-impedance buffer based around an ultra-low noise JFET. R28 sets the input impedance at 1M Ohms, which is ideal for instrument pickups. R29-R31 set the DC operating point of the JEFT, and C16 and C14 keep this DC isolated from the rest of the circuit. The JFET, T5, takes the high-impedance instrument input and turns it into a low-impedance output that can be sent to the preamp. R25 and R26 attenuate the input signal 35dB to microphone level.

### Populate Other Components {.step}
Populate the diode, transistors, capacitors, and relay. The diode, electrolytic capacitors, tantalum capacitors, transistors, and relay are polarized. On the tantalums the positive lead is longer and marked with a "+". Orient the transistors according to the outlines on the PCB. Also note that the two transistors are different. T5 is silver on top and the footprint on the PCB is filled in.

<!-- Section 3 -->

## Balanced Input {.step}
<img class="schematic" src="/assets/73p2/block03-input.png" />
This section does the job of receiving the balanced input from the microphone and converting it to an unbalanced signal that can be used by the rest of the preamp. This is delicate work because any noise introduced here will be amplified many times by the preamp. This is why the input transformer X1 is in a metal can to shield it from interference.

Some parts of this circuit block we populated already in sections 1 and 2, but we'll explain them here. R15, R16, and R17 make up the LINE input. These resistors form a voltage divider that attenuates the input signal 20dB and increases the input impedance to ~10k Ohms when the LINE switch is in. Phantom power is sent to the mic input through R21 and R22. R20 and C13 give the phantom power a bit of a soft start when the switch is engaged. And R18 sets the brightness of LED1. The Lo Z switches the wiring of the transformer primaries from series (default, normal impedance) to parallel (low impedance). The transformer performs several functions: it eliminates hum by isolating the grounds of the input and the rest of the circuit, it amplifies the input signal 6dB (9dB with the Lo Z switch in), and it converts the balanced input signal to unbalanced. The capacitor C40 makes the frequency response of the transformer more linear by damping ringing.

J1 feeds into the DI circuit and also triggers a switching circuit. T4 is a transistor configured as a switch. When a plug is inserted in the DI jack, it changes the state of the transistor, which in turn changes the relay U1. By default, with nothing in the DI jack, U1 sends the signal from the input transformer to the rest of the circuit. With a plug in the DI jack, it takes the signal from the DI circuit instead.

### Place Capacitor {.step}
Locate the rectangular transformer sub-board. Place the capacitor in the C40 position. This and the other film capacitors are not polarized, so they can be placed in either direction.

After soldering, trim the leads very close to the solder joint, as we will be installing the input transformer on top of them.

### Place Header {.step}
Place the longer, straight pins of the 8-pin header through the transformer board so that the black plastic posts sit flush with the PCB. Double check that you have inserted it on the correct side of the board: the plastic posts should be sitting in the X1B position on the same side of the board as C40. Solder and trim the leads close to the joints.

### Place Input Transformer {.step}
Remove and discard the two screws from the brown side of the VTB9045 transformer next to the pins.

Place the transformer on the opposite side of the board from C39 and X1B. Pay close attention to the pin numbers printed on the transformer and on the PCB. Double check that they are aligned before soldering. It <em>is</em> possible to put the transformer in backwards. And if you do it's difficult to remove and expensive to replace.

Attach the board to the transformer with the two black screws. This will require a bit of force, as the screws are cutting the threads. If the board starts to bend, back them off a bit. Then solder and trim the transformer pins.

### Place Transformer Assembly {.step}
Place the transformer assembly on the motherboard so that the exposed pins of the header sit in the X1A footprint. Solder a couple pins of the header from the top of the board to hold it in place. Then flip the board over and solder all of the pins from the bottom side. Since the pins do not protrude through the bottom of the board, there is no need to trim.

## Gain {.step}
<img class="schematic" src="/assets/73p2/block04-gain.png" />
This style of mic preamp handles gain in a unique way. Instead of simply varying the gain of an amplifier, it controls a combination of attenuation, feedback, and switching amplifiers in and out of circuit. This is why for this section we  have a rotary switch and lots of resistors rather than a single potentiometer.

At gain settings 0-50dB the signal passes only through PRE 2 before going to OUTPUT. The resistors attached to steps 0-35dB create voltage dividers to attenuate the input signal before it is amplified by PRE 2. At 45dB and 50dB R64 and R65 increase the gain of PRE 2. At 55dB, the switch sends the signal to PRE 1 before PRE 2. R56-R59 attenuate the signal between the preamp stages. Finally, at 70dB, both preamp stages are engaged with no attenuation between them.

### Place Rotary Switch {.step}
We are going to take a lot of care in soldering the rotary switch. This is because, like the input transformer, it is expensive (about $50 at the time of writing) and almost impossible to remove once soldered. Follow the steps below to make sure the switch is on the correct side and perfectly flush with the PCB.

Remove the plastic covers from the rows of pins. Place the rotary switch in the larger notch in the front of the bracket with the pins facing up. Fasten the switch to the bracket with the nut. Discard the lock washer. Place the GAIN board over the pins of the switch so that the side that says, "All parts other side!" is visible.

Now solder a single pin near the middle of the rotary switch. Remove the assembly from the bracket and visually confirm that the switch is perfectly flush to the PCB. If the switch is not flush, put it back in the bracket to hold it in place, reheat the single solder joint, and press down on the board until it snaps into place. Once you've confirmed that the switch is flush, solder the rest of the pins and trim the leads. Finally, check that you have soldered all the pins and that there are no solder bridges between them.

### Place Header {.step}
Place the side with shorter pins in the CON1B position on the same side of the board as the switch and the rest of the components. The long pins should face up and reach to just about the top of the switch. Double check that the header is on the correct side of the board, then solder.

{% lightbox '/assets/73p2/04-test.jpg', 'md' %}

### Test GAIN {.step}
        
1. Optional: If you have clip probes for your meter, solder leftover component leads in the TP1, TP2, and TP3 test points. The next steps will go faster if you can clip to those test points.
2. To make this step easier with two hands, attach the large knob from bag 8.2 to the GAIN switch. Use a flat head screwdriver to tighten the set screw on the knob. The position of the knob pointer doesn't matter for now.
3. Set the meter to resistance. If there are multiple ranges, set it to 20k.
4. Put the black probe on TP1 and the red probe on TP2. Now check the resistance at each position. They should be within 10% of these values:
- 1 (counter-clockwise): 6.9k
5. 2: 4.8k
6. 3: 4.9k
7. 4: 5.1k
8. 5: 6.1k
9. 6: 12k
10. 7: 12k
11. 8: 12k
12. Now move the red probe to TP3 and check the remaining positions:
- 9: 2.7k
13. 10: 5.4k
14. 11: 8.7k
15. 12: 12.6k
16. Remove and set aside the knob and screwdriver until section 8.

If any of the readings are wrong, double check your resistor placement and soldering. See the schematic at the beginning of this section for which resistors are related to which positions on the switch. In the schematic the bottom is position 1 and the top is 12.

<!-- Section 5 -->

## PRE 1 {.step}
<img class="schematic" src="/assets/73p2/block05-pre1.png" />
The PRE 1 and PRE 2 sections are the amplifiers that provide the lion's share of the 73P's gain. Both are essentially the same circuit. The only differences between the two are the values of the feedback (R1 and R66) and PRE 1 has an extra resistor, R4 to increase the gain.

The PRE 1 and PRE 2 amplifiers each consist of just three transistors. T1/T12 and T3/T11 amplify the voltage, while T2/T13 is an output buffer that amplifies the current. The capacitors C9/C33 and C10/C37 AC-couple the input and output, preventing DC from entering or leaving the circuit. The rest of the components act to set the bias points of the transistors, and keep them stable with lots of feedback and filtering.

R5/R74 sets the gain of the amplifier, which in its normal configuration is 18dB. At the 45 and 50dB gain settings, the GAIN switch adds resistors in parallel with R74 on PRE 2 to increase the gain to 23 and 28dB. PRE 1 has a fixed resistor, R4, added to set the gain to 30dB.

### Populate Resistors {.step}
Populate the resistors in the PRE 1 block on the motherboard. Note that R4-R14 should be placed on the bottom of the PCB. This is to leave room for the gain switch which goes above the PRE 1 block.

### Populate Transistors {.step}
Place leads of the transistors through the nylon spacers (it doesn't matter which of the four holes in the spacer you use). Then place the transistors and spacers in positions T1-T3. The polarity of these metal-can transistors is indicated by a small tab on the body. Make sure that the tab matches the drawing on the PCB, then solder and trim the leads.

### Populate Components {.step}
Populate the other components, except for the potentiometer VR3 and header CON2B. As you did in the last section, pay close attention to the polarity of the transistors and polarized capacitors. Remember to put the spacers on the transistors before soldering. The trimpot VR2 should also be placed according to the outline on the PCB.

<!-- Section 7 -->

## OUTPUT {.step}
<img class="schematic" src="/assets/73p2/block07-output.png" />
The OUTPUT section provides more voltage gain and the output current needed to drive the next device in the signal chain. The output is another three-transistor amplifier. T6 and T7 provide voltage gain, while the big power transistor T8 provides the current. T8 and X2 form a transformer-coupled amplifier. The VR1 trimpot sets the bias of T8 for the lowest distortion and highest headroom. R39 sets the gain of the amplifier. The OUTPUT block provides 18dB of gain, with 4dB of this provided by the output transformer.

### Solder Jumpers to Transformer {.step}
Begin by tinning the ends of the black hookup wire. Do this by heating the exposed wire and then adding a bit of solder. Wrap the ends of the wire around pins 6 and 7 of the transformer. Then heat the pin and wire for about five seconds, then add solder.

Find a bit of leftover component lead (you probably have them lying all over your work surface). Wrap this lead around pins 2 and 4 of the transformer, then solder.

- Drivers: ASIO (Windows only)
4. Device: Your audio interface
5. Sample rate: 44.1kHz
6. Output: The output you connected in step 2
7. Input: The input you connected in step 2
8. Secondary output: Uncheck
9. You can ignore all other options such as Timing reference output, Sweep level, etc.
10. Close Preferences, open the Generator window and set these options:
- Tones (very top-left button)
11. Sine
12. Frequency Hz: 1,000
13. Level units (radio button): dBFS
14. Level: -20dBFS
15. You can ignore all other options.
16. Press the green play button. Then open the Levels window. The Out meter should read exactly -20dbFS and the In meter should read very close to this (you can ignore the Ref In meter). If the In meter reads within +/-1dB of -20dBFS, REW is set up and you can skip the next step and proceed to 9.2.
17. If the In meter does not read -20dBFS, check the following things:
- If the output or input gain is set by your interface drivers or control software, make sure they are set to 0dB.
18. If the interface gain is set by the operating system, make sure it is set to the maximum level.
19. If the In level is about 6dB too low, you may have a bad cable. Try setup again with a different balanced cable.
20. Finally, after ruling out the other options, adjust the interface gain to compensate. Some interfaces (especially 2-channel ones) are not designed to have 0dB gain by default at the line input. Others do not have a line input at all so you must use a mic input. For these cases, set the output knob to the maximum level, and adjust the input gain until the In meter in the REW Levels window reads -20dBFS.

### Test Output {.step}
The first test is very simple, we are just going to make sure the 73P is passing signal from input to output.

        
1. Connect inputs and outputs to the 73P.
2. Set all switches OUT, gain to 0dB, and TRIM fully clockwise.
3. From the REW Generator send a 1kHz, -20dBFS signal.
4. Open Levels in REW. The In meter should read within a couple dB of -20dBFS (we will calibrate this precisely in a moment).

If your 73P is not returning -20dBFS, first confirm the gain of your test setup again. Removing the 73P from the chain, connect the output directly to the input. Verify that you are getting 0dB gain; that is, -20dBFS should be coming back to the Levels meter in REW. If this is working, check the mechanical connections to the sub-boards and X2 on the 73P. Make sure nothing is plugged into the DI jack and that the TRIM is set clockwise. Finally, check the placement and soldering in the OUTPUT section.

### Calibrate Output Transistor {.step}
In this step we will set the bias of T8 for the highest headroom possible. Before starting this test, power up the 73P and let it sit for at least 15 minutes. This gives the transistors time to reach their normal operating temperatures.

        
1. Set your multi-meter to read DC volts. (If your meter has multiple DC ranges, set it to 20v DC).
2. Probe both of the BIAS test points in the OUTPUT section. It does not matter which probe goes on which side.
3. Trim VR1 until the meter shows 2.5VDC (or -2.5VDC depending on which way you have placed the probes).

### Calibrate Gain {.step}
        
1. Keep the input and output connected as in the previous steps.
2. In the REW Generator, send a 1kHz, -60dBFS signal.
3. Set all switches OUT, GAIN to 50dB, and TRIM fully clockwise.
4. Open Levels in REW. The In meter should be within a few dB of -10dBFS.
5. Trim VR2 on the PRE 2 board until In reads as close to -10dBFS as possible.

### Test Features {.step}
Finally, we will go through each feature one-by-one to make sure your 73P is working perfectly.

        
1. Keep your connections the same as the previous steps and set the Generator level back to -10dBFS and open Levels.
2. Start with all switches OUT, gain at 0dB, and TRIM fully clockwise.
3. <strong>Polarity:</strong> Toggle the &empty; switch IN and OUT. As long as the In level stays the same, the switch is working correctly.
4. <strong>Lo Z:</strong> Engage the Lo Z switch. The In level should increase by about 3dB.
5. <strong>LN:</strong> Engage the LN switch. The In level should drop by ~25dB.
6. <strong>TRIM:</strong> Turn the knob completely in both directions. At fully CCW the In level should drop about 80dB.
7. <strong>Gain:</strong> Set the Generator to -65dFS and the 73P gain to 55dB. The In level should be about -10dBFS.

Note there is no <strong>48</strong> test step because we already tested phantom power in section 1. <em>Do not engage the 48 switch while the 73P mic input is connected to your audio interface.</em>
