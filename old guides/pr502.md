This guide is for the PR502 2.0, released January 2020. For earlier versions visit the [PR502 1.x Guide](https://www.diyrecordingequipment.com/pages/pr502-1-4-assembly-guide).

## Resistors and Diode (Bag 1) {.step}

---

{% lightbox '/assets/15ips/res-bend.jpg', 'md' %}

### Bend Resistors {.step}

Bend the resistor leads 90 degrees at the body so they can be inserted into the PCB.

---

### Sort Resistors {.step}    

Resistor values are identified by colored bands on the body of the resistor. To sort resistors, use our [Resistor Color Code Calculator](https://www.diyrecordingequipment.com/pages/resistor-color-code-calculator) or test them with a multi-meter set to read resistance. (Pro tip: to measure resistors quickly you can remove the probes from your multi-meter and place the leads of the resistor directly in the probe sockets.)

---

{% lightbox '/assets/pr502/res-place.jpg', 'md' %}

### Place Resistors {.step}

Place the resistors into their respective positions on the PCB. As you place each resistor, bend its leads against the bottom of the PCB so that it stays in place during soldering.

---

{% lightbox '/assets/pr502/res-solder.jpg', 'md' %}

### Solder Resistors {.step}

Solder the resistors to the PCB. Observe good soldering technique: heat the pad and lead for 2-3 seconds, apply a small bit of solder, and continue to heat the pad for another 2-3 seconds. The finished joints should be shiny and should have just enough solder to cover the pad entirely.

---

{% lightbox '/assets/pr502/res-trim.jpg', 'md' %}

### Trim Resistors {.step}

Use clippers to trim away the excess leads. Clip as closely as possible to the joint without clipping the joint itself.

---

{% lightbox '/assets/pr502/diode.jpg', 'md' %}

### Populate Diode {.step}
Place the diode so that the line on the component matches the line on the PCB. Double check the orientation, then solder and trim.

    <strong>Note:</strong> Starting in 2024, D1 is black with a gray line.

## Capacitors, LEDs, Switches, and Inductors (Bag 2) {.step}

---

{% lightbox '/assets/pr502/caps-small.jpg', 'md' %}

### Populate Small Capacitors {.step}

Place the smaller capacitors in their respective places. These capacitors are not polarized and therefore can be placed in either direction. Solder then trim the leads.

---

{% lightbox '/assets/pr502/leds-bend.jpg', 'md' %}

### Insert LEDs {.step}
Place the LEDs, inserting them as far as the flat parts of the leads.

        <strong>Polarity:</strong> Place the longer lead in the "+" hole.

---

{% lightbox '/assets/pr502/leds-place.jpg', 'md' %}

### Bend and Solder LEDs {.step}
Bend the LEDs forward to where the rear panel will be, then solder and trim.

---

{% lightbox '/assets/pr502/scr.jpg', 'md' %}

### Populate SCR (U1) {.step}
Place the SCR in the U1 position. Make sure to align it so that the silver metal part on the body aligns with the stripe on the PCB. Check the orientation, solder, and trim.

---

{% lightbox '/assets/pr502/header.jpg', 'md' %}

### Populate LINK Header {.step}
Place the 2-pin, LINK header with the longer leads facing up. Then place the 2-pin shunt over the pins and solder. You may need to use a piece of tape to hold the header in place for soldering.

---

{% lightbox '/assets/pr502/switch-cap.jpg', 'md' %}

### Install Switch Cap {.step}   

Press the cap onto the switch.

---

{% lightbox '/assets/pr502/switch-place.jpg', 'md' %}

### Populate Switch {.step}  

Place the switch and use a small screwdriver to bend a couple of the leads against the bottom of the PCB. Solder and trim.

---

{% lightbox '/assets/pr502/inductors.jpg', 'md' %}

### Populate Inductors {.step}

Place the inductors in their positions, solder, and trim. Inductors are not polarized.

---

{% lightbox '/assets/pr502/caps-large.jpg', 'md' %}

### Populate Large Capacitors {.step}

These capacitors are polarized, so they must be placed in a certain direction. The positive lead is slightly longer, while the negative lead is marked with a stripe on the body of the capacitor. Place the capacitors with the positive lead in the pad next to the "+" marking on the PCB. Double check their orientation, then solder and trim.

## XLR Jacks and Standoff (Bag 3) {.step}

---

{% lightbox '/assets/pr502/xlr.jpg', 'md' %}

### Populate XLR Jacks {.step}

Place the XLR jacks. Most will snap in place, but you may need to use some tape if they fall out before soldering. Solder the jacks but do not trim the leads.

---

{% lightbox '/assets/pr502/standoff.jpg', 'md' %}

### Populate Standoff {.step}
Place the long screw through the bottom of the PCB, then thread the two standoffs onto it from the top.

## Card Edge Connectors (Bag 4) {.step}

---

{% lightbox '/assets/pr502/connector-bracket.jpg', 'md' %}

### Install L-Brackets {.step}
Place the brackets on the underside of the board as shown. It may be hard to see, but one end of the L-brackets is longer than the other. Fasten the longer end to the PCB via the short, silver screws from the top side of the PCB.

---

{% lightbox '/assets/pr502/connector-solder.jpg', 'md' %}

### Populate Card Edge Connectors {.step}
Place the card edge connectors through the side of the board labeled J7/8. Press the connectors down so they sit flush with the board. Solder the card edge connectors to the PCBs and trim the leads. Make sure to solder on the side that has no labeling.

---

{% lightbox '/assets/pr502/connector-attach.jpg', 'md' %}

### Attach Card Edge Boards to Motherboard {.step}
Locate the CON2 and CON3 positions on the bottom of the motherboard. Place the shorter end of the right-angle headers in these positions with the longer pins facing out away from the PCB.. Then place the card edge boards over the longer pins so they protrude through CON3/4. Then fasten the card edge board to the motherboard with the black screws.

---

{% lightbox '/assets/pr502/connector-solderheader.jpg', 'md' %}

### Solder Headers {.step}
Solder the headers to both the motherboard and card-edge board. Then trim the excess leads from the card-edge board.

## Chassis (Bag 5) {.step}

---

{% lightbox '/assets/pr502/chassis-rear.jpg', 'md' %}

### Attach Rear Panel {.step}
Screw the rear panel to the XLR jacks. Place the lock washers on the lower screw hole of each jack.

---

{% lightbox '/assets/pr502/chassis-side.jpg', 'md' %}

### Attach Side Panels {.step}
Screw the side panels to the rear panel using the shorter, pan head screws.

---

{% lightbox '/assets/pr502/chassis-topbottom.jpg', 'md' %}

### Insert Top and Bottom Panels {.step}
Slide the top and bottom panels into the channels in the side panel. Orient them so that the vents are near the rear panel.

---

{% lightbox '/assets/pr502/chassis-front.jpg', 'md' %}

### Attach Front Panel {.step}
Screw the front panel to the case using the flat-head screws.

## Final Checks {.step}
---

Before you wrap up, check the following things:

{% checks 'capacitor', 'diode', 'resistor', 'solder' %}
